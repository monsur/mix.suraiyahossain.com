  🔴 High Priority

  1. Upgrade TypeScript from 4.9.5 to 5.x
    - You're currently on 4.9.5 (from Dec 2022), latest is 5.9.3
    - TypeScript 5 has better performance, smaller npm package, and improved features
    - Should be a straightforward upgrade
  2. Migrate from Create React App to Vite
    - CRA is in maintenance mode and no longer actively developed
    - Vite offers much faster dev server, faster builds, and better DX
    - This is the biggest architectural change but future-proofs the project
    - Alternative: Could stay on CRA if you want minimal maintenance
  3. Update TypeScript compilation target
    - Currently targeting ES5 (from 2009)
    - Modern browsers support ES2020+, which produces smaller bundles
    - Recommend ES2020 or ES2022 as target
  4. Add Node.js version management
    - No .nvmrc or .node-version file
    - Helps ensure consistent Node version across environments
    - Prevents "works on my machine" issues

  🟡 Medium Priority

  5. Add tests
    - Testing infrastructure exists but no actual tests
    - Consider adding basic component and integration tests
    - Could help prevent regressions during annual updates
  6. Add CI/CD pipeline
    - No GitHub Actions workflow detected
    - Could automate builds, tests, and deployments
    - Catch issues before they reach production
  7. Consider switching from HashRouter to BrowserRouter
    - Currently using hash-based routing (#/2024)
    - BrowserRouter gives cleaner URLs (/2024)
    - Would need server configuration for gh-pages (might not be worth it)
  8. Improve PWA manifest
    - Missing 512x512 icon (recommended for PWA)
    - Could add more descriptive name and description
    - Consider adding screenshots for PWA installation
  9. Add error boundaries
    - No React error boundaries detected
    - Would prevent full app crashes from component errors
  10. Improve type safety
    - setCurrentTrackPos prop typed as Function instead of specific function signature
    - Several eslint-disable comments could be addressed
  11. Update HTML meta description
    - Currently: "Web site created using create-react-app"
    - Should be descriptive of your actual site

  🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have

  12. Add explicit ESLint and Prettier configs
    - Currently using CRA defaults embedded in react-scripts
    - Custom configs give you more control and work better with editors
  13. Add dependency update automation
    - Add Dependabot or Renovate
    - Automates the annual dependency update process
  14. Add bundle size monitoring
    - Tool like webpack-bundle-analyzer or source-map-explorer
    - Helps track bundle size over time
  15. Add pre-commit hooks
    - Husky + lint-staged for running linters before commits
    - Ensures code quality consistency
  16. Consider service worker for offline support
    - Make the music player work offline
    - Would improve PWA experience
  17. Add code splitting
    - Currently loading all year data at once
    - Could lazy-load year data for faster initial load
  18. Consider Google Analytics 4 best practices
    - Using gtag.js correctly, but could add consent management
    - Consider adding more structured event tracking

  📊 Summary

  If you only do 3 things:
  1. Upgrade TypeScript to 5.x (quick, low risk)
  2. Add .nvmrc file (quick, very helpful)
  3. Decide on CRA vs Vite migration (biggest architectural decision)

  Time vs Impact:
  - Quick wins: #1, #4, #11 (< 30 min total)
  - Medium effort: #3, #5, #6, #8 (few hours each)
  - Large effort: #2 (several hours, but worth it for future maintenance)
